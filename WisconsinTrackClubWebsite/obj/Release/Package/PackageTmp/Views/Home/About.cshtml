            <h1>About us</h1>
            <p>
                The Wisconsin Track Club was founded in 1991 to foster interest in the sports of track & field and 
                cross-country and to provide athletes of all abilities with the chance to train together. WTC teams 
                participate in NCAA Division III track and cross-country meets around Madison, WI. We sponsor a series of 
                low-key, neighborhood track meets on Thursdays in the summer at the McClimon track as well as a number of road 
                races in and near Madison. Cross country workouts September-October. Meet at the corner of Langdon and Park. T
                rack workouts at the Shell (January-March), or at McClimon (April-May). Please stop by and check us out!
